      "description": "Hawaiian garlic shrimp is made by crushing whole garlic cloves (skin-on) in a mortar and pestle to release the wonderful aroma and oils from the garlic cloves.  The crushed garlic is then slowly sautéed in butter and oil until nicely brown and crispy.  Large skin-on shrimp is sautéed with soy sauce and fish sauce and then tossed in the lovely toasted garlic.  Serve as is or with cauliflower rice.",

      "description": "Tempura shrimp is a typical dish found on Chinese and sushi takeout menus across the United States. It’s a favorite appetizer or side dish to order for its simple flavors and style. Classic tempura shrimp is battered in a wet flour mixture and deep fried. This Keto recipe creates the same style of shrimp without the high carbohydrates and excess oil. Pork rinds serve as a crispy breading, and a brush of avocado oil in a cast iron skillet is all you need for frying. You can whip up this recipe as part of a fast, hot lunch or dinner. On its own, the recipe can be enjoyed as a yummy Keto snack or made in bulk for a finger-food appetizer. Enjoy your Keto tempura shrimp with friends and little ones for your next game day get together!\n\n### What Is Tempura?\n\nTempura is a Japanese style of deep frying. The cooking style can be used for all types of meats and vegetables. A classic tempura batter is made with a unique mixture of flour, eggs, and cold water. The key is to have just the right combo of cold water and hot oil for deep frying. This is what creates the iconic light, crispy, and bubbly texture tempura batter offers. The Keto rendition of tempura mirrors the same effect with pork rinds. Without deep frying, you still get the crispy texture and Keto fats without excess grease and mess.\n\n### What Type Of Pork Rinds Should I Use?\n\nTo achieve a crispy, golden outside, a pork rind breading is applied to the Keto tempura shrimp. You can find any generic bag of pork rinds at your grocery store. At your discretion, you can season your pork rind breadcrumbs when you make them. Simply add any seasoning to your food processor when blending them into crumbs. For another fun twist, you can choose spicy pork rinds to add some heat to your favorite fried foods. The finer you can grind up your pork rinds, the better they will stick to any meat you wish to bread.\n\nJessica L.",

Press the crumbs into the shrimp so they adhere, leaving a thin and even coating.",

      "description": "This Keto take on Mongolian beef is cooked in a sweet and sticky low carb glaze, rich with warming spices and seasonings. This is a quick and easy dinner option perfect for weeknight meals when you are short on time. Ideal served alongside your favorite Keto Chinese inspired sides.\n\n### How to Make Keto Mongolian Beef\n\nMongolian beef is often prepared with a coating of corn starch before being pan-fried with a sauce to create a sticky all-over glaze. Our easy Keto Mongolian beef is prepped with xanthan gum as an alternative to using corn starch. Using xanthan gum is a great way to thicken your Keto sauces while keeping the carb count low. Once the beef has browned, it is stir-fried with aromatic garlic, warming ginger, tangy tamari sauce and a sweet maple-flavored syrup. The delicious ingredients combine and thicken to create a sweet and sticky coating for the beef strips.\n\n### Serving Suggestions\n\nWe have served our Keto Mongolian beef with sliced scallions for extra flavor and texture. You could also serve with a scattering of fresh chopped cilantro. This easy Keto stir fry beef is perfect paired with plain Keto cauliflower rice, low carb stir-fried vegetables or Keto egg fried rice. Alternatively, this makes a great lunch filling served in simple lettuce leaf cups.",

        "Finely crush the garlic and grate the ginger. Add the garlic and ginger to the skillet and sweat gently for a minute to soften. Add the tamari sauce, water and maple-flavored syrup. Stir together well to combine. Simmer the sauce for a minute until bubbling and beginning to thicken.",
        "Return the steak strips to the skillet. Stir well to combine with the sauce. Pan-fry the beef for 2-3 minutes more until the sauce is reduced right down and thickened to a sweet sticky glaze, coating the beef all over. If the skillet gets too dry, you can always add a splash more water. This will help to deglaze the pan and lift any caramelized sauce from the base of the skillet. If your sauce is not thickening, you may also add a touch more xanthan gum as required.",
